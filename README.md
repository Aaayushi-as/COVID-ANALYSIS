# COVID-ANALYSIS
COVID data analysis involves studying data on cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations to understand the spread and impact of the virus. It helps in tracking trends, making informed decisions, and improving responses to future health crises.
PROJECT - COVID 19

FILE 1 : [DATA CLEANING BY MYSQL - COVID PORTFOLIO PROJECT.sql](http://github.com/Aaayushi-as/COVID-ANALYSIS/blob/main/COVID%20PORTFOLIO%20PROJECT.sql)
* Performed some basic operations and functions so that data can be easily explored and visualized by Tableau.
* Extracted 4 sub .csv files
  
1. [Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv](Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv)
2. [Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv](Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv)
3. [Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv](Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv)
4. [Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv](Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv)

FILE 2 : [Data Cleaning by Python - Covid data cleaning.ipynb](Covid-data-cleaning.ipynb)
* In this file, I've dropped some unnecessary fields from the .csv file by using pandas.
* Divided the original dataset into two .csv files:
  
1.CovidDeaths.csv

2.CovidVaccinations.csv

You can find these datasets here- [Divided.covid.datasets.zip](Divided.covid.datasets.zip)

FILE 3: [Covid Dashboard.twbx](Covid Dashboard (3).twbx)
* By using the 4 csv files extracted by SQL, I've visualized them on a single dashboard. Explore and play around with it. Thank you!
* Glimpse to that dashboard->
